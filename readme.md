The following project was tested in DeepinOS and its code base was created in MacOS. Maybe (or not) some modifications are necessary, in cases of SOs other than those two.

üóò **Warn1:** In the Chrome browser, you need to install the [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) so that everything works fine.

üóò **Warn2:** In the Firefox browser, you need to install the [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) so that everything works fine.

üóò **Warn3:** Still not working perfectly well, There are still **inconsistencies**.

> **üù∞ New update:** This project has been **successfully tested** on **windows**, step settings below:
>  
> * Download [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=75.0.3770.8/). (At the time of this update the current version is at 75.0.*)
> * Unzip and save to a new folder. ( `C:\Webdrivers` preferably ).
> * Set the path folder in the system environment variables. ( `path` preferably ).

That said, let's go.

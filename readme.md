# Automatic Git Project Launcher

## Before we start

**üóò** ‚ûû Still working on it.  
**‚úî** ‚ûû Working well.  
**üòº** ‚ûû Pay attention.

The following project was tested in DeepinOS and its code base was created in MacOS. Maybe (or not) some modifications are necessary, in cases of SOs other than those two.

**üòº** **Warn0:** Some commands used directly in the terminal work well on Linux and MacOS systems but maybe not on Windows.

‚úî **Warn1:** In the Chrome browser, you need to install the [chromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) so that everything works fine.  
‚úî **Warn2:** In the Firefox browser, you need to install the [geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) so that everything works fine.

üóò **Warn3:** Still not working perfectly well, There are still **inconsistencies**.

**üù∞ New update 1:** This project has been **successfully tested** on **WINDOWS**, step settings below:
>  
* Download [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=75.0.3770.8/). (At the time of this update the current version is at 75.0.*)
* Unzip and save to a new folder. ( `C:\Webdrivers` preferably ).
* Set the path folder in the system environment variables. ( `path` preferably ).

## What I Do.

I'm a small project that automates the creation of repositories on both the computer and the GitHub platform.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
  - Selenium (available on pip)
    - webdriver (Chrome)
  - Sys (native)
  - Os (native)

## How to install

- Clone this project:
  > `git clone https://github.com/silv4b/initproject.git`

## How to use

- Into the folder
  > `Python3 onfolder.py <arg1> <arg2> <arg3>`

  Where:
  - arg1 = username
  - arg2 = password
  - arg3 = repository name

To start syncing your workspace, just sign in with Google in the menu.

- The file synchronization will keep one file of the workspace synced with one or multiple files in **Google Drive**, **Dropbox** or **GitHub**.
	> Before starting to sync files, you must link an account in the **Synchronize** sub-menu.
